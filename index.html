            <p class="welcome-message">Thanks for stopping by my teaching portfolio.  I have I have 15 years experience teaching business and economics at the high school, university, and graduate school level.  I spent over 10 years living and working in China where I met my wife and started a family.  I returned to the US a few years ago and am excited to find a high school teaching opportunity that can make use of my experience! </p>
