        </div>

        <p>
            I believe that <strong>student engagement is the foremost important element of teaching and learning</strong> and the simplest way to ensure students are gaining something from the class.
        </p>

        <p>
            I endeavor to maximize engagement through demonstrated enthusiasm for the material, regular, routinized dialogue with students, and a supportive environment where mistakes are treated as learning opportunities. I have always felt that if I am bored teaching a class, I can be assured the students are also bored, which means they are not learning. When I find the material I am teaching to be interesting, exciting, and relevant, my intellectual energy keeps students awake and focused; I believe fun and learning are not mutually exclusive, and <strong>I expect my classes to be characterized by "joyful rigor."</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to maintain student engagement, <strong>my most relied upon tool is frequent, non-volitional questioning.</strong> By setting a classroom environment where anybody can be expected to be called upon at any time, students quickly learn to be active listeners and ask questions when they are unclear. I have found that a combination of open-ended questions and targeted inquiries directed toward specific individuals works best to challenge students at their individual levels of understanding.
        </p>

            However, for students to be truly engaged, they must also feel they have the proper tools and knowledge to discuss and analyze concepts. This is why I feel that at every level of education, <strong>scaffolding is essential</strong>, especially when introducing a subject such as economics, which includes concepts that are not always intuitive. For my classes, this includes sufficient modeling of quantitative economic models, guided step-by-step tasks in creating diagrams, and consistent practice through formative assignments.
        </p>

        <p>
            When students are given enough support when introduced to new ideas initially, it results in <strong>solid conceptual understanding and the ability to apply logic using sound reasoning and analysis.</strong> 
        </p>

        <div class="img-placeholder"></div>

        <p>
            Additionally, students must be made to feel safe to make mistakes along this way. I achieve this through teacher demonstration of best practices when making an error, openly acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes and modeling how to learn from them. I seek to set a <strong>growth-mindset culture from day one</strong>, which assumes that mistakes are an inevitable and valuable part of the learning process. I tell my students that if they aren’t making mistakes, then the material is likely too easy for them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, no student will maintain interest in a subject unless they can find personal relevance. Finding connections between the material and current economic news serves the dual purpose of <strong>grounding abstract theory in reality</strong> and encouraging students to analyze global and local developments through the lens of their academic endeavors. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My focus is on developing student skills beyond mere memorization, moving toward a level where they are able to apply ideas and use them in meaningful evaluation. I believe that <strong>student engagement is the key</strong>, and these are a few of the ways I ensure my students are active participants in their own educational journey.
