                    This Pulse Check artifact demonstrates my commitment to the whole-child approach by recognizing that physiological and emotional needs directly impact cognitive performance. By surveying students on their sleep, nutrition, and external stressors alongside a content-based warm-up, I acknowledge that intellectual growth cannot occur in a vacuum. This daily data allows me to pivot my instruction in real-time, providing necessary "safety nets" or additional scaffolding for students who are not currently in an optimal state for high-level learning.
